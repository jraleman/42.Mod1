check comments: a line with a # (ft_trim)

coordinates will have to be separated with numbers

one of the rows can't be over (20, or whatever the pdf says about 
coordinates)
one of the columns can't be over that too

missing coordinates will be filled with zeros

a coordinate value range from (0 to 9, or maybe up to F)

skip whitespaces (tabs, spaces, etc...)

any other character than xdigits and/or lines staring with a #, should
return an error 

values, such as name and other things (colors, terrain, etc...), should 
be defines at the top of the file, starting with a $, and the name must 
be in all caps. then it should be followed by a = sign, skip 
whitespaces, and then whatever else is gonna be saved in an array of 
strings, and compared to the real values of the game. If one is missing 
or failed, set default values.

cap the strings if one of the values is larger than what's required 
(like a name with 100 characters)

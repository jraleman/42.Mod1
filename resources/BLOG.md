# Making of: 42_Mod-1

## Chapter 0 - What Language?

Because this is an academic project, I wanted to try out and at least get myself familiar with a "mainstream" language.

Because of this, I decided to go with Java, because when learning about React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, etc.js... I kinda realized that having a strong foundation of Object Oriented programing language is very important.

Some people hate OOP, and for some people it is a kind of a fetish...? Maybe, I don't know.

## Chapter 1 - Good Practices

After getting fresh using Java with the command line interface or terminal, I did some researching to see what is the best way to structure a basic Java project by yourself.

I believe that a file and directory structure is very important, but also having one that reflects your project, kind of custom made, is wonderful in the long run.

I saw something called `Maven`, and I was kinda familiar with it because of my experience as a react native developer (a lot of debugging makes you fix iOS and Android issues).

After a quick guide, I managed to get a `Hello world!` app running... but it took me a couple of hours. I was having issues using my school's computers, but as soon as I `git clone`d the repository, I managed to run the app without any issues.

On the good side, I learned how to use `maven` right away, because of debugging and stuff.

## Chapter 2 - Design

Reading carefully the pdf, and trying to understand as much as I can (a skill that I am still lacking to this day, but trying to make as much progress as possible)... I divided the project into 3 main components:

### Graphics

...

### Parsing

...

### Math Stuff

...

#### Imagination

...

Main idea of the project, if you could visualize it I guess?
